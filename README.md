//Project 3 Milestone 1// 

You already have the tools needed to move a player with "tank-style" controls. 

You can set your camera's X and Y position to be the same as your player and your camera will follow your player through the game world. 

By the end of this week, you should have an understanding of how Canvas works well enough to add UI elements as well. 

Start a new project. Find some sprites ( For example: Kenney.nl (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.   or    LPC  (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.   or  find a Game Art Student ) and get started on your project. 

//Deliverable//

Project and Details - Create a new unity project and repository for your Project. Submit the URL for your repository for this project milestone.  You MUST have player sprites and movement included for full points.
